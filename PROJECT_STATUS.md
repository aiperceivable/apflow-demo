# Project Status

## ✅ Completed

### 1. Project Structure
- ✅ Created independent `apflow-demo` repository
- ✅ Set up project structure with proper Python package layout
- ✅ Configured `pyproject.toml` with `apflow[all]` dependency
- ✅ Created all necessary directories and files

### 2. Core Extensions
- ✅ **Rate Limiter**: Implemented Redis-based rate limiting with per-user and per-IP daily limits
- ✅ **Demo Results Cache**: Implemented pre-computed results cache for demo tasks
- ✅ **Usage Tracker**: Implemented usage statistics tracking

### 3. API Layer
- ✅ **API Server Wrapper**: Created wrapper that uses `apflow.api.main.create_app_by_protocol()`
- ✅ **Rate Limit Middleware**: Implemented middleware for rate limiting
- ✅ **Demo Mode Middleware**: Created middleware framework (note: actual interception should be at route level)

### 4. Configuration
- ✅ **Settings Module**: Implemented configuration management with environment variables
- ✅ **Environment Files**: Created `.env.example` with all configuration options
- ✅ **Demo Config**: Created `demo/config.yaml` for demo-specific settings

### 5. Docker & Deployment
- ✅ **Dockerfile**: Created production Dockerfile
- ✅ **Dockerfile.dev**: Created development Dockerfile
- ✅ **Docker Compose**: Created docker-compose.yml with Redis service
- ✅ **Deploy Script**: Created deployment script

### 6. Scripts
- ✅ **Pre-compute Script**: Created script for pre-computing demo results
- ✅ **Setup Script**: Created script for initializing demo data

### 7. Website Integration
- ✅ **Demo Button**: Added demo button to aiperceivable-website ProjectDetail component
- ✅ **Project Data**: Added demo URLs to project data structure

### 8. Documentation
- ✅ **README**: Created comprehensive README
- ✅ **Deployment Guide**: Created detailed deployment guide
- ✅ **License**: Added Apache-2.0 license

## ⏳ Pending (User Action Required)

### 1. Demo Result Interception
- ⚠️ **Note**: Demo result interception in middleware is simplified. For production, consider:
  - Implementing route-level interception
  - Creating custom route handlers that wrap apflow routes
  - Using request/response hooks in apflow

### 2. Pre-compute Actual Results
- ⏳ Execute demo tasks with LLM API keys
- ⏳ Replace placeholder results in `demo/precomputed_results/`
- ⏳ Verify all demo tasks have valid results

### 3. Deployment
- ⏳ Deploy demo API service to production server
- ⏳ Configure domain and SSL/TLS
- ⏳ Set up monitoring and logging

### 4. WebApp Integration
- ⏳ Deploy apflow-webapp
- ⏳ Configure webapp to point to demo API URL
- ⏳ Test end-to-end flow

### 5. Website Updates
- ⏳ Update demo URLs in aiperceivable-website environment variables
- ⏳ Deploy updated website
- ⏳ Test demo links

## 📝 Notes

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Independent Repository**: Created as separate repository to keep demo code isolated from community release
2. **Wrapper Pattern**: Uses apflow as dependency, wrapping its API with demo-specific middleware
3. **Configuration-Driven**: All demo features controlled via environment variables
4. **Redis for Rate Limiting**: Uses Redis for distributed rate limiting (can scale horizontally)

### Known Limitations

1. **Demo Result Interception**: Current middleware implementation is simplified. For production, route-level interception is recommended.
2. **Body Reading**: Middleware body reading can be complex - consider using route-level handlers instead.
3. **User ID Extraction**: JWT user ID extraction not fully implemented - needs enhancement for per-user rate limiting.

### Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Demo Interception**: Implement route-level demo result interception
2. **JWT User Extraction**: Extract user ID from JWT tokens for accurate per-user rate limiting
3. **Analytics Dashboard**: Create dashboard for usage statistics
4. **Admin API**: Create admin API for managing rate limits and demo results
5. **Multi-region Deployment**: Support for multi-region deployments with Redis cluster

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Pre-compute Demo Results**: Execute demo tasks and save results
2. **Deploy Demo API**: Deploy to production server
3. **Deploy WebApp**: Deploy apflow-webapp with demo API URL
4. **Update Website**: Deploy website with demo links
5. **Test End-to-End**: Verify complete demo flow works
6. **Monitor**: Set up monitoring and alerting
